    <h3>Garlic Soy Sauce Tri-Tip</h3>
    <p>This recipe takes a little bit of a different direction than 
        typical Tri-Tip recipes. This recipe will involve cutting the 
        Tri-Tip into smaller steaks which are then seasoned indivually
        this leads to very flavorful and juicy steaks. 
    </p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Whole Tri-tip (about 2 lbs.)</li>
        <li>Garlic Powder</li>
        <li>Bottle Of Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Splash of Beer(Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Use a butcher's knife to cut the Tri-Tip along the grain
            into pieces around 1" thick. (they will be different lengths because
            of the shape of the roast)</li>
        <li>Place steaks into a Cake pan and pour one bottle of
            soy sauce onto steaks and into pan.
        </li>
        <li>Sprinkle a generous amount of garlic powder over the steaks
            and into the pan. (You may now add a splash of your favorite beer if you would like)
        </li>
        <li>Let the steaks marinate for around 20 minutes before removing
            from pan and placing on the grill.
        </li>
        <li>Get a good sear for around 2 minutes on each side and then proceed
            to grill them to your desired level of doneness.
        </li>
        <li>Top steaks off with a small amount of butter on top 
            while still fresh off the grill.
        </li>
        <li>Ready to serve!!</li>
    </ol>
